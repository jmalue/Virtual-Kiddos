Create a class (Kid) that represents any of your children. 
The Kid class should have a constructor that allows for a kid's name, and a description. 
It should also allow for the following actions: Play and Eat.
"play" and "eat" should be methods that affect 2 other fields (variables) in the Kid class.
Those 2 variables are satiation (reverse of hunger) and happiness.
Your app class should ask the user for
The kid's name
The kid's description
Then, you should ask the user if they want to play with one of the children. 
Each time they play, you should call the Play method for the kid (in the kid class). 
That play method should increase the happiness field for the kid.
On top of that, your app should ask if the user wants to feed the kid. 
When yes, it should call the eat method in the Kid class. 
The eat method should increase the kid's satiation by 1.
Finally, you should print out the kid's satiation and happiness levels.
